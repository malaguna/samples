# PrimeFaces p:calendar 'beforeShowDay' attribute

PrimeFaces has an attribute that allows you to enable/disable days and also to change css style. However I found some difficulties when tried to use some back bean method to determine which days must be disabled.

After some research I found a way tested against IE, FireFox and Chrome. Here it is a fully working sample, and [here](http://malaguna.github.io/blog/2015/11/12/beforeshowday/) you can find a blog entry explaining this code.
